# Ground

A simple down to earth cloud alternative.

## Why is it simple?

- No database
- No external dependencies
- Single binary with embedded files
- Just a frontend for a linux file server

## Installation

The easiest way to get the executable is to download it from the [latest release](https://github.com/grantfbarnes/ground/releases/latest).

However, if preferred, the executable can be built manually:

```sh
cd src
go build .
```

After you have the executable (either through download or manual build), simply place it somewhere in your `PATH`.
